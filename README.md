# Export images to Imgur from Gimp 2.99 and Gimp 3.0

Export images to Imgur from Gimp 2.99 and Gimp 3.0

Installation
============

To install this plugin, copy ``imgurUpload.py`` to your GIMP plugins folder. This
folder can be found by going to Edit -> Preferences -> Folders -> Plug-Ins. Restart
GIMP and the plugin can be accessed under the File menu.

Note: If you are using the Flatpak for Gimp 2.99 beta, you will be missing Python's ``requests`` module.  If you are using Arch linux, you can find the latest Gimp at https://mirrors.zju.edu.cn/archlinuxcn/x86_64/ along with required gegl, babl and libart-lgpl packages (if you want to avoid compiling it yourself until a stable release comes out).
